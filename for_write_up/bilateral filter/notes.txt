size 5 is default for running in real time,
size 9 is recomended for offline file processing
but my real time runs with an image very second so larger sizes work.

inside fiolder size 9 there are images wherte the amount of bilateral filter is varied.
others contain fixed amount but varying size of the filter.

concluded size 10 amount 175 for training, compare to base training.
